# Setup
Once it is finished, this repo should bootstrap the setup of a new environment for me.
Currently, it is very close to what ThePrimeagen has in his [repo](https://github.com/theprimeagen/dev).
Time will tell if it stays that way or if I will deviate from it 
(most likely the case, since I am using multiple Linux distros).
